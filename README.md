# TITANIC-PROJECT
### **Section 1 (CASE STUDY INTRODUCTION)**
This project focuses on predicting passenger survival from the Titanic disaster using supervised machine learning. The goal is to build a logistic regression model with Scikit-learn to determine which passengers were more likely to survive based on data like age, gender, class, and fare. The notebook is structured into four main sections, providing a complete end-to-end analysis using the Titanic dataset.
