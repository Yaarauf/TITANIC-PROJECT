**INTRODUCTION** 
The Titanic disaster remains one of the most maritime tragedies in history, claiming the lives passengers and crew. This project leverages anaysis from the Titanic passenger to explore patterns and factors that influenced the survival outcomes of passangers. Using Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to uncover insights into variables such as age, gender, passenger class, and fare,etc. Analysis through data cleaning, visualization, and statistical analysis. These insights guide the development of a predictive Machine Learning (ML) model designed to classify whether a passenger survived or not.
